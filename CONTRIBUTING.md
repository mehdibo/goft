# How to contribute

This is an open source project, all contributions (Issues, suggestions and Pull requests) are welcome.

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please:

1. Make sure there is no already open Issue.
2. Make sure the issue hasn't been fixed (look for closed Issues)

Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull Request, which is done by "Forking" the main repository and committing to your own copy.
This will require you to use the version control system called Git.

## Guidelines

Here are the guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request.

### Documentation

If you change anything you need to update any documentation in the command line

### One issue at a time

Please submit one fix per pull request, so that even if a fix is not desired, we can still benefit from the other fixes.

### Branching

All pull requests need to be sent to the "develop" branch.
